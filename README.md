# CIFAR Image Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 different classes.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: CIFAR-10
- **Number of Classes**: 10 (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck)
- **Training Samples**: 50,000
- **Testing Samples**: 10,000

## 📜 Features
- Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Augmentation)
- CNN-based model for image classification
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics
- Training with GPU acceleration
- Visualization of training progress and predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sivaramaraju2124/CIFAR-Image-Classification.git
   cd CIFAR-Image-Classification
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app (if deployed):
